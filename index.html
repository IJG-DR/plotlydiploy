        <div class="brief">
          <p>
          We have partnered with Improbable Beef, a startup, to research 
          bacterial species that are able to synthesize proteins that taste 
          like beef. Labs across the country have had success in synthesizing 
          beef from algae, fungi and microorganisms found on plant roots. 
          However, Improbable Beef is still searching for the elusive bacteria 
          that will provide the perfect taste. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Our hypothesis is that the organism that can provide this next best 
          taste can be found quite close to home -- from bacteria found on the 
          human body. The human body is a source of thousands of types of 
          bacteria and different parts of the body harbor different species. 
          Bacteria found in the gut are not the same species that are found in 
          a person’s eyelashes, for example. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Furthermore, between individuals, the bacterial species may vary even 
          in the same location. We have hypothesized that the ideal bacterial 
          species to make synthetic beef may be found in the belly button, or 
          at least, in someone’s belly button. 
          <br>
          <br>
          To test our hypothesis, we have sampled the navels of people across 
          the country to identify bacterial species that colonize our belly 
          buttons. Each person’s identity is anonymous, they have instead been 
          assigned an ID number. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Select the participant’s ID from the drop-down menu at left to see 
          which bacterial species live in their navels. Hover over the graphs
          for further detail of bacteria types.
